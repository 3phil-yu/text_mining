The\\nscanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly\\naccurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art\\nsettings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I\\nfrequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image\\nin the note.  Hope this helps!\\n\"\n",
